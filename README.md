## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pierre-Alain, a fullstack developer with strong interest in ops.

Sinced the beginning of my career, I worked in IT industry as different roles. Everytime I run away, IT industry draw me back and says "No, you stay with me". So, I guess, instead of run away or fight against, I have to embrace the light :sun:

At the moment, I'm working as a Quality Engineer. My mission is to automate tests somewhere between integration testing and e2e testing.

### BUT

Today I'm working with really inspiring people and the current context of my mission made me want to learn more about web development. I always thought web dev was boring but that was because I've never really did that. And more than web development, it's all the thing connected to the web ecosystem like SRE, monitoring, logging that drives me.

So I'm coming back to development, learning new stuff and review some basic learnt long ago which evolved a lot! But it's really cool!

So if you're looking for a new enjoyed team mate to work with, come and we can discuss about the potential of me becoming a part of your team ! 

With my strong background in IT industry, my ability to love to learn new things, I will be a nice choice to be part of your projects!

My objectives as a developer are : 
* Clean coding more than anything
* Clean Architecture
* Learning and teaching new things or approaches
